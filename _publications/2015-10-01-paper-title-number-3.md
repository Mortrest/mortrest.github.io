Blockchains today generate huge amounts of transaction data that need efficient real-time analytics for various applications like detecting smart contract hacks, performing arbitrage on decentralized exchanges, or analyzing trending tokens. However, conventional blockchain nodes and specialized ETL-based analytics systems struggle with a tradeoff between pre-calculating query results and analytical flexibility. To address this, we present AlterEgo, a blockchain node designed specifically for analytics. It can process consensus-produced blocks while providing a robust analytics API. Our prototype supports efficient transactional and analytical processing without the limitations of ETL workflows. It offers a more reliable trust model and achieves significant performance improvements compared to existing solutions.
