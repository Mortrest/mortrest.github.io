------
![range](/images/range.jpg){: .align-right width="250px"}  

Wow, this book is seriously mind-opening!! It delves deep into the idea that being a jack-of-all-trades can be awesome and help you become a master of some things, while being too specialized can actually hinder innovation. I've always believed that experience is crucial, but this book reminded me that it can also hold you back from innovating and tackling new challenges. It reinforced the importance of never getting complacent and always striving to improve and learn new things, even if you don't think they'll come in handy. It's all about expanding your horizons, you know? Like they say at the end of the book, "Don't compare yourself to younger people who aren't you, compare yourself to the person you were yesterday." This book is a fantastic read and I highly recommend it!!
