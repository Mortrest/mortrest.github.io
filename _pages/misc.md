Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World (David Epstein)
------
![range](/images/range.jpg){: .align-right width="250px"}  

Wow, this book is seriously mind-opening!! It delves deep into the idea that being a jack-of-all-trades can be awesome and help you become a master of some things, while being too specialized can actually hinder innovation. I've always believed that experience is crucial, but this book reminded me that it can also hold you back from innovating and tackling new challenges. It reinforced the importance of never getting complacent and always striving to improve and learn new things, even if you don't think they'll come in handy. It's all about expanding your horizons, you know? Like they say at the end of the book, "Don't compare yourself to younger people who aren't you, compare yourself to the person you were yesterday." This book is a fantastic read and I highly recommend it!!

Complexity: A Guided Tour (Melanie Mitchell)
------
![complexity](/images/complexity.jpg){: .align-right width="290px" }  

This book provides a general and immersive introduction to the fascinating field of complexity. Complexity, which covers various scientific areas like biology, computer science, genetics, and network theory, is explored with exceptional clarity and depth by the author.  

The book explores topics like chaos theory, uncovering the secrets of how seemingly random patterns can arise from seemingly predictable systems. It also explores fundamental ideas like information and complexity, presenting different perspectives from computational, entropic, and statistical viewpoints.  

Using captivating examples and thought-provoking studies, the book brings to life the idea of emergent phenomena in simple structures like "cellular automata." It also explores the intriguing connection between computability and natural structures.  

Throughout the book, the author emphasizes the importance of looking at complex systems through the lenses of nonlinearity, decentralized control, and statistical representation of information. By doing this, the book challenges the limitations of a reductionist approach.  

I particularly enjoyed the chapter on Stephen Wolfram and cellular automata, as well as the section on evolutionary algorithms such as the genetic algorithm.  

For anyone interested in a delightful and mind-expanding introduction to the study of complexity, especially those with a background in computer science, this book is a true gem.

The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable (Nassim Nicholas Taleb)  
------
![Black swan](/images/blackswan.jpg){: .align-right width="250px" }  

Black Swan, those crazy unlikely events (like google's crazy success, 9/11 attack, and the internet being invented), show that social sciences suck at predicting all sorts of stuff (including people's behavior), by only using that boring Gaussian "bell curve" thing. Using math in social sciences makes us think we know a lot (based on stuff that already happened), but really we don't know squat about what's gonna happen in the future. Not many science papers actually manage to predict stuff accurately, and most great inventions happen by accident. Taleb came up with a different approach, something called the Mandelbrotian thing (which I don't really get).  

To someone like me who loves stats, *Black Swan* is super convincing. Taleb's got a funny way of talking, always throwing in some satire. Taleb is totally in that category. If we put him on a bell curve, he'd be way out there on one end (either super left or super right), but that's not gonna happen 'cause he hates bell curves.

I cannot fully describe the treasure that this book is, so I will stop here and highly encourage you to read it.

Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty (Daron AcemoÄŸlu, James A. Robinson)  
------
![nations](/images/nation.jpg){: .align-right width="250px" }  

For a really long time, I've been super interested in understanding what makes some countries rich and successful. This question has been on the minds of people in less developed countries for like forever, as they look at their own situation and compare it to the fancy developed countries in the West. They see all these magazines, books, and movies showing how modern and inclusive the Western world is, and it makes them curious. In this age of postmodernity, with all the cool social media and communication tech, it's like impossible not to make these comparisons. It makes a lot of people in less developed countries want to find answers that can help them improve their own situation and be on the same level as other countries.  

So, there's this book, right? It's by Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson. Basically, they talk about why some nations fail and others become all rich and successful. Their main idea is pretty straightforward: nations with inclusive political and economic systems do well, while nations with extractive systems struggle and make life hard for their people. The book can be broken down into 4 main parts:  

> 1. There needs to be a centralized entity with some level of authority in a county for it to progress.  
> 2. Revolutions only succeed if many parties are involved and not a single group. They will only succeed if they empower many groups to participate in the governing body.  
> 3. Growth under extractive institutions is possible but not sustainable e.g., USSR, and China.  
> 4. Extractive governments provide a larger incentive for groups or individuals to want to topple the current dictator and be the dictator.  

A must read book for all people in 3rd world countries.  
This book is one of the few that really changed the way I think about History and Democracy.
