Here is a review of some of the best non-fiction books that I've read. I also read a lot of fiction and manga, but I prefer not to include them here (Guilty pleasure ðŸ˜„).

Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World (David Epstein)
------
![range](/images/range.jpg){: .align-right width="250px"}  

Wow, this book is seriously mind-opening!! It delves deep into the idea that being a jack-of-all-trades can be awesome and help you become a master of some things, while being too specialized can actually hinder innovation. I've always believed that experience is crucial, but this book reminded me that it can also hold you back from innovating and tackling new challenges. It reinforced the importance of never getting complacent and always striving to improve and learn new things, even if you don't think they'll come in handy. It's all about expanding your horizons, you know? Like they say at the end of the book, "Don't compare yourself to younger people who aren't you, compare yourself to the person you were yesterday." This book is a fantastic read and I highly recommend it!!

Complexity: A Guided Tour (Melanie Mitchell)
------
![complexity](/images/complexity2.jpg){: .align-right width="250px" }  

This book provides a general and immersive introduction to the fascinating field of complexity. Complexity, which covers various scientific areas like biology, computer science, genetics, and network theory, is explored with exceptional clarity and depth by the author.  

The book explores topics like chaos theory, uncovering the secrets of how seemingly random patterns can arise from seemingly predictable systems. It also explores fundamental ideas like information and complexity, presenting different perspectives from computational, entropic, and statistical viewpoints.  

Using captivating examples and thought-provoking studies, the book brings to life the idea of emergent phenomena in simple structures like "cellular automata." It also explores the intriguing connection between computability and natural structures.  

Throughout the book, the author emphasizes the importance of looking at complex systems through the lenses of nonlinearity, decentralized control, and statistical representation of information. By doing this, the book challenges the limitations of a reductionist approach.  

I particularly enjoyed the chapter on Stephen Wolfram and cellular automata, as well as the section on evolutionary algorithms such as the genetic algorithm.  

For anyone interested in a delightful and mind-expanding introduction to the study of complexity, especially those with a background in computer science, this book is a true gem.

The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable (Nassim Nicholas Taleb)  
------
![Black swan](/images/blackswan.jpg){: .align-right width="250px" }  

Black Swan, those crazy unlikely events (like google's crazy success, 9/11 attack, and the internet being invented), show that social sciences suck at predicting all sorts of stuff (including people's behavior), by only using that boring Gaussian "bell curve" thing. Using math in social sciences makes us think we know a lot (based on stuff that already happened), but really we don't know squat about what's gonna happen in the future. Not many science papers actually manage to predict stuff accurately, and most great inventions happen by accident. Taleb came up with a different approach, something called the Mandelbrotian thing (which I don't really get).  

To someone like me who loves stats, *Black Swan* is super convincing. Taleb's got a funny way of talking, always throwing in some satire. Taleb is totally in that category. If we put him on a bell curve, he'd be way out there on one end (either super left or super right), but that's not gonna happen 'cause he hates bell curves.

I cannot fully describe the treasure that this book is, so I will stop here and highly encourage you to read it.

Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty (Daron AcemoÄŸlu, James A. Robinson)  
------
![nations](/images/nation.jpg){: .align-right width="250px" }  

For a really long time, I've been super interested in understanding what makes some countries rich and successful. This question has been on the minds of people in less developed countries for like forever, as they look at their own situation and compare it to the fancy developed countries in the West. They see all these magazines, books, and movies showing how modern and inclusive the Western world is, and it makes them curious. In this age of postmodernity, with all the cool social media and communication tech, it's like impossible not to make these comparisons. It makes a lot of people in less developed countries want to find answers that can help them improve their own situation and be on the same level as other countries.  

So, there's this book, right? It's by Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson. Basically, they talk about why some nations fail and others become all rich and successful. Their main idea is pretty straightforward: nations with inclusive political and economic systems do well, while nations with extractive systems struggle and make life hard for their people. The book can be broken down into 4 main parts:  

> 1. There needs to be a centralized entity with some level of authority in a county for it to progress.  
> 2. Revolutions only succeed if many parties are involved and not a single group. They will only succeed if they empower many groups to participate in the governing body.  
> 3. Growth under extractive institutions is possible but not sustainable e.g., USSR, and China.  
> 4. Extractive governments provide a larger incentive for groups or individuals to want to topple the current dictator and be the dictator.  

A must read book for all people in 3rd world countries.  
This book is one of the few that really changed the way I think about History and Democracy.

The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom (Jonathan Haidt)
------
![nations](/images/happy.jpg){: .align-right width="250px" }  

I'm seriously blown away by how people can completely toss reason out the window when it comes to public debates about land use.  

In his book, "The Happiness Hypothesis," Jonathan Haidt breaks down why we struggle so damn hard to change our opinions and behaviors. By mixing up old-school wisdom with cognitive research, Haidt dives deep into happiness, meaning, and what the hell makes us act so damn weird sometimes. He hammers home the idea that understanding how the human mind works is crucial, and he gives some killer tips for finding happiness. Haidt also gets into the nitty-gritty of how our minds are basically in a constant battle with each other, where emotions often take the lead over reason. He lays it out that our brains are wired to prioritize survival, which means we've got a major bias towards negativity and totally irrational reactions to stuff we think is threatening. These knee-jerk responses make it super tough to think ahead and let rational arguments sink in.  

To make some real changes in our attitudes and behaviors, Haidt suggests putting our focus on training the emotional side of our minds instead of just relying on conscious thought. He's all about self-improvement practices like meditation, cognitive therapy, and even Prozac. By helping folks get a handle on their social lives and automatic responses, we can dial down the influence of our emotional instincts during public debates and actually connect better with others.

Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner)
------
![freak](/images/freak.jpg){: .align-right width="250px" }  

First of all, what does the title of the book mean? The book is about two prominent economists, Freakonomics (meaning "out of the ordinary" in their own words), who explore cultural and social issues and try to find unconventional answers using economic techniques (for example, one of the laws of economics: People react to incentives).  

If you love economics, proving issues with statistics, thinking outside the box, analyzing data, and sociological issues in general, I'm sure this book can satisfy a good portion of your desires. Overall, this book does not have a unified theme. Each chapter raises a question and in pursuit of answering that question, we encounter dozens of other questions and answers. These questions may seem very ordinary at first glance, but in their depth, answers are found that we may have never thought of, and all of these answers are justified using statistics and data analysis.  

In this book, what we are primarily dealing with is "Conventional wisdom", meaning a unified cultural and social perspective on issues that the majority of society agrees on. The book begins with the sentence "The conventional wisdom is often wrong," and the main focus of the book is challenging these social taboos.  
In other sections, the book delves into the issue of cheating among students and even professors, examines the economics of drug substances up close, or addresses issues of racial and gender discrimination, proving that many things we accepted as facts may not be true and we need to look at the issues from a different perspective to find the real answer.  

A significant portion of the book deals with a different view of the correlation and causality between common phenomena in society, which is extraordinary in its own right, to the extent that you probably won't be able to put the book down until the end of the chapter!  
**If you have some social-cultural concerns and believe that some issues are not as they should be, give this book a try. Read it and feel the power of social sciences ðŸ˜‡**  

> Lastly, a sentence from the book:  
> "If morality represents the ideal world,  
> Economics represents the actual world"  



Steve Jobs (Walter Isaacson)
------
![steve](/images/steve.jpg){: .align-right width="250px" }  

After having read this biography for a third time now, I have made peace with this fact and will just write whatever comes to my mind at this very moment.  

Steve Jobs was a standout figure among entrepreneurs and celebrities. He had a unique and intense personality, driving him to revolutionize multiple industries in his relatively short but highly productive career. Jobs had a keen eye for beauty and a wide range of interests, positioning himself at the intersection of art and technology.  
While Jobs was both a jerk and a genius, this biography presents an honest portrayal of him. It portrays his quirks, his ability to distort reality, and his binary worldview. Despite any personal opinions about him, the book evokes emotions, especially as it was written during his battle with cancer.  
Jobs had the potential to continue changing the world, and it's remarkable to reflect on the things we take for granted today because of his vision and determination. He often believed that people didn't know what they wanted until he showed them, a mindset exemplified by his famous quote from Henry Ford.  

> "The best way to predict the future is to invent it."  

This is not just a success story. Jobs co-founded the world's most valuable company in his parents' garage. However, there were also failures after the initial success with the Apple II and the Macintosh. After detours with NeXT (another failure) and Pixar (a huge success), he returned to Apple (at the time a sinking ship) and turned them into a huge success story.  

I gotta say, the main reason this book really hits home for me is that it was such an exciting time. Man, I would have absolutely loved to be there when Jobs (and his buddies and rivals) were inventing the future. I mean, with Jobs, it would have been an absolute blast, and yeah, probably pretty darn frustrating too.
